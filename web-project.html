                The Team Introduction Website is designed to showcase our team members, their roles, and the unique
                skills they bring to the group. The primary goal is to provide a platform that highlights the team’s
                expertise, fosters transparency, and strengthens connections with clients, collaborators, or the broader
                audience.</p>
            <p>
                This website will serve as a professional and engaging digital portfolio, where visitors can learn about
                the team’s background, projects, and accomplishments. It will feature individual profiles for each
                member, including their photos, bios, and areas of expertise, alongside an overview of the team’s
                mission and values.

        <p><b>Design</b></p>
        <div id="style">
            <p style="border: 1ch;">
                The design for the team introduction website features a clean, full-width layout with a responsive grid
                system to showcase team profiles. The color scheme includes a primary color for highlights (e.g.,
                headings), a secondary color for accents, and a neutral background for readability. Typography uses
                modern fonts like Poppins for headings and Roboto for body text, with a balanced font size and line
                height for clarity. Team photos are styled rounded corners. The navigation bar is sticky with a simple
                underline, and the footer has an ada-blue background with light text and social media icons. The design
                is optimized for desktop, ensuring a seamless user experience. All colors, fonts, and effects can be
                easily customized.

        <p><b>Navigation Bar</b></p>
        <div id="style">
            <p>
                The navigation bar is designed to be a sticky element positioned at the top of the webpage but the
                buttom of the picture. It features a clean and minimalist style, with active links while inactive links
                are styled in dark gray for contrast. This design ensures the navigation bar is both functional
                and visually appealing, offering an intuitive browsing experience across all devices.
